We wish to thank everyone for their contribution in making this happen but most particularly to Nicholas Thomas of OFIM and Joe Tshupula of AFN for their help on and off the field. Our message to our players and sailors is that we will run the Club to the best of our abilities to ensure that we do not deviate from our core values of respect, fair play and integrity.  Above all, we want to run a club where members of the community can participate without any discrimination or prejudice of any kind.</p>

                        On the football side, we are aiming to create a private veteran football league and we invite other partners who would like to be associated with our vision to join us. For the future trajectory of the club, we will be anchored on our strong desire to invest in AFN infrastructure in Labourdonnais that can accommodate a home ground and a clubhouse to be enjoyed by all sports participants and their families.</p> 
                     <p>We want to grow a fan base by creating a safe and conducive atmosphere full of fun.  We try to connect and interact with our sportsmen to encourage participation in the Clubs’ affairs.To the Club sponsors and AFN, our message is that the Club will strive to be ran based on best good governance principles of Accountability and Responsibility. As a club, we believe that good governance is essential if the club is to be managed effectively and to survive in difficult economic circumstances affecting sport participation in the northern region of Mauritius.</p>  
                     <p>On the sailing side, we want to state that we are always open to investing in youth sailing because we want to leave a lasting impression and experience for our youths and ourselves. The club wants to democratize sailing in Mauritius as this will create as many opportunities as possible for the youths and the club. <br>

                    <p class="snip-p">The Founding Committee members first met in August 2019 whist playing for another football team in Grand Bay. It was the right vibe and Monday nights become a ritual to meet at the social clubhouse Chez Doune after football practice. A strong friendship grew and early 2022, it was decided to regroup through a separate team Corinthians SC.
                      Although being an amateur sports club run by volunteers from within its membership, the level of professionalism shown in all facets of the Club is remarkable. The managing committee is made up of a diverse group of individuals who are sound professionals in their own right and each brings vital elements to the management of AFN Corinthian SC. Their commitment and dedication to the “Chachoos” is such that no challenge is insurmountable.
                      Our club has three principal activities and the ethos of the club is to compete at the highest amateur level: Veterans Football, Beach Soccer & Sailing</p>

                      <p class="snip-p">We are affiliated with the Mauritius Football Association, and we have applied to be part of the Mauritius Yachting Federation. The issue of social responsibility in high in our agenda and we continually implement programs that seek to improve the society we live in. 
                        Our coaches have a passion for the game that is transferred to all the participants. Players and sailors are allowed to express themselves, participate without fear of making mistakes, be encouraged to make their own decisions in sessions and enjoy to the maximum their respective sports.
                        We met Joe Tshupula of AFN Academy in June 2022 and it felt like an epiphany.  We share similar values and took the decision to partner with AFN to become AFN Corinthians SC.  Joe brings a wealth of experience as an ex-professional football player and a national coach. The structured approach he has adopted with AFN Football Academy felt right with what the club is trying to achieve.
